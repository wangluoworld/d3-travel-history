Travel History
====

A simple visualization of places I've travelled to in my life, using [D3](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/) and [TopoJSON](https://github.com/mbostock/topojson). You can see an example here: [teekirol.github.io/travel](http://teekirol.github.io/travel/).

This project was inspired by [cheeaun.github.io/life](http://cheeaun.github.io/life). 

Making Your Own
====
1. Fork this project.
2. Replace the contents of `places.csv` with your own stuff
3. Preview it on a local server, eg. `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`
4. You might have to alter the scaling and centering values depending on which countries you want to fit in.
